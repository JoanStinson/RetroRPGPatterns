# Retro RPG Patterns
A tiny retro action RPG implementation made applying Software Design Patterns to serve as a guide of solutions that can be applied to specific problems.

* **🔊 Behavioral Patterns**
    * Define a concrete communication scheme between objects.
* **🐣 Creation Patterns**
    * Create objects, rather than instantiating them directly.
* **✂️ Decoupling Patterns**
    * Split dependencies to ensure that changing a piece of code doesn't require changing another one.
* **🛠️ Optimization Patterns**
    * Speed up the game by pushing the hardware to the furthest.
* **⏰ Sequencing Patterns**
    * Invent time and craft the gears that drive the game's great clock.
* **🧬 Structural Patterns**
    * Use inheritance to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.
