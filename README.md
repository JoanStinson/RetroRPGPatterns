# Retro RPG Patterns
A tiny retro action RPG implementation made applying Software Design Patterns to serve as a guide of solutions that can be applied to specific problems.

* **🔊 Behavioral Patterns**
    * Define a concrete communication scheme between objects.
* **🐣 Creational Patterns**
    * Create objects, rather than instantiating them directly.
* **✂️ Decoupling Patterns**
    * Split dependencies to ensure that changing a piece of code doesn't require changing another one.
* **🛠️ Optimization Patterns**
    * Speed up the game by pushing the hardware to the furthest.
* **⏰ Sequencing Patterns**
    * Invent time and craft the gears that drive the game's great clock.
* **🧬 Structural Patterns**
    * Use inheritance to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

## 🔊 Behavioral Patterns
Define a concrete communication scheme between objects.
* ### Bytecode
* ### Chain of Responsibility
* ### Command
* ### Interpreter
* ### Iterator
* ### Mediator
* ### Memento
* ### Observer
* ### State
* ### Strategy
* ### Subclass Sandbox
* ### Template Method
* ### Type Object
* ### Visitor

## 🐣 Creational Patterns
Create objects, rather than instantiating them directly.
* ### Abstract Factory
* ### Builder
* ### Factory Method
* ### Prototype
* ### Singleton

## ✂️ Decoupling Patterns
Split dependencies to ensure that changing a piece of code doesn't require changing another one.
* ### Component
* ### Event Queue
* ### Service Locator

## 🛠️ Optimization Patterns
Speed up the game by pushing the hardware to the furthest.
* ### Data Locality
* ### Dirty Flag
* ### Object Pool
* ### Spatial Partition

## ⏰ Sequencing Patterns
Invent time and craft the gears that drive the game's great clock.
* ### Double Buffer
* ### Game Loop
* ### Update Method

## 🧬 Structural Patterns
Use inheritance to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.
* ### Adapter
* ### Bridge
* ### Composite
* ### Decorator
* ### Facade
* ### Flyweight
* ### Proxy
